### Deconvolution infers the properties of pure glycan species

![**Deconvolution infers the properties of pure glycan species.** A) Schematic of the process of deconvolution. Briefly, the observed properties of a glycan mixture can be considered to be an additive combination of the individual molecular species. Therefore, with measurements of the mixtures' properties, we can fit the inferred properties of individual species. B–C) Inferred anti-D (B) and anti-TNP (C) ADCC activities of individual glycan species, allowing each species to have its own inferred activitity. D–E) Inferred activity with the additional assumption that fucosylated forms share their activity, and that sialation does not affect activity (e.g., G1 and G1S share activity). F–G) Comparison of the inferred anti-D (F) and anti-TNP (G) ADCC for each mixture to the mixture activity measurements. Error bars indicate the 67% confidence interval (standard error).](figure2.svg "Figure 2"){#fig:fig2 width="100%"}
